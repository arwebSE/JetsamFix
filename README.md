# JetsamFix
This is a [Theos](https://iphonedevwiki.net/index.php/Theos) tweak, used as workaround for crashing daemons issue, that started appearing in iOS 13 but is still present in iOS 14.
The project is focuses to workaround issues in iOS 14, therefore it does not work on iOS 13. This tweak will only be tested on iOS 14.

This project is a fork of [StopCrashingPls](https://github.com/hbang/StopCrashingPls) made by [HASHBANG Productions](https://github.com/hbang). If you have issues in iOS 13, you should probably use that version instead.
